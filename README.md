# First Project - Data Analysis

This project is centered around exploratory data 
analysis [(EDA)](Terezas_EDA_Checklist.pdf) techniques and statistical analysis, 
as well as simulation.

## Topic and Task

You will use the Muesli data you have already worked with in the first week of our course.

Your task will be to perform an EDA on the data as well as to build a simulation model to answer specific questions of our stakeholder. 
You can find the detailed task description [here](Assignment.pdf).

## Getting Started

- Please create a new repository on GitHub. 
- Create a new virtual environment using:  

```BASH 
# Create new environment
$ conda create --name <env_name>
# Activate environment 
$ conda activate <env_name>
# Installing packages 
$ conda install <package_name>
```
- Activate your environment 
- Also after having created this environment, you can install additional packages within it. **Therefore you need to have activated your environment**!
- Start jupyter lab and start with your EDA!

## Suggested workflow - POC
The work is timeboxed, and with that in mind, you need to change how you approach the task. You will want to employ an iterative approach. 

* Write rough draft of plan with placeholders
* Do simple plots
* Main questions should already be answered -> POC (proof of concept) 
* Iterate: go deeper, go prettier, go better
* Clean up .. feel free to delete things that are not useful anymore
 

**Have fun and do not stress yourself too much!!!**
