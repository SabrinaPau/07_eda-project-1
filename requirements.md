## First Project - EDA     
 
This is your first project during the bootcamp. You'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset. Here, the focus is on EDA though you are required to demonstrate an entire Data Science Lifecycle using linear regression.
 
## The data
- The dataset can be found in the respective folders in this repository.
- The description of the column names can be found in the `column_names.md` files. 
- The column names may NOT be clear at times:

    *In the real world we will run into similar challenges. We would then go ask our business stakeholders for more information. In this case, let us assume our business stakeholder who would give us information, left the company. Meaning we would have to identify and look up what each column names might actually mean. (google is your friend ;) )*
 
## Tasks for you
1. Create a new repo using [the template](hhttps://github.com/neuefische/ds-eda-project-template).  

2. Through EDA/statistical analysis above please come up with **AT LEAST 3** insights/recommendations for your stakeholder. 
Note, you can take either the perspective of a buyer or a seller. 
If you use linear regression in the exploration phase remember that R2 close to 1 is good.

3. Then, model this dataset with a linear regression to explain the data but also to evaluate how well the model is fitting the data. We do expect **residuals** plotted for the model.
 
## The Deliverables
1. A **well documented Jupyter Notebook** (see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ekami66/detailed-exploratory-data-analysis-with-python) for an example) containing the code you've written for this project and comments explaining it. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project. Do not push all the analysis... just the analysis that is relevant!
2. A Python script for training the model, printing out the model statistics and saving the model.
3. An **organized README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.
4. A **short Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides/Jupyter slides presentation** giving a **high-level overview** of your methodology and recommendations for **non-technical stakeholders**. The duration of the presentation should be **10 minutes**, then the discussion will continue for 5 minutes. Also put your slides (delivered as a PDF export) on Github to get a well-rounded project.
